  <p>  An EV is a shortened acronym for an electric vehicle. EVs are vehicles that are either partially or fully powered on electric power. Electric vehicles have low running costs as they have less moving parts for maintaining and also very environmentally friendly as they use little or no fossil fuels (petrol or diesel).
  </p> 
  <h3> Advantages</h3>
  <p>
    <b> <u>1. No Gas Required:</u> </b>
Electric cars are entirely charged by the electricity you provide, meaning you donâ€™t need to buy any gas ever again. Driving fuel-based cars can burn a hole in your pocket as prices of fuel have gone all-time high.
  </p>
  <p>
  <b><u> 2. More Convenient</u></b> 
The electric vehicle is easy to recharge, and the best part is you will no longer need to run to the fuel station to recharge your car before hitting the road! Even a normal household socket could be used for charging an electric car.
